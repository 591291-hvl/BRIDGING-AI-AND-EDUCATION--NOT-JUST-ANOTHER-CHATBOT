### Task:
You will be given a list of related questions on a specific topic. Your goal is to generate a single, well-phrased question that captures the core theme and intent of the original questions.

### Guidelines:

    - Identify common patterns: Look for recurring words, themes, and intent.
    - Generalize effectively: Retain relevant information while avoiding unnecessary specificity.
    - Omit hyper-specific details: Ignore overly detailed aspects unless they represent a major trend.
    - Ensure clarity and conciseness: The final question should be natural, grammatically sound, and easy to understand.
    - Response format: Your output should consist only of the aggregated question, with no additional text.

### Example
Input:

    - What is SGD?
    - Why use SGD?
    - When should I use SGD?
    - How do I implement SGD?
    - Is SGD better than GD?
    - How do I implement SGD with NumPy?

Output:

"What is SGD and when should it be used?"
